**Motivation:** Many schools still rely on outdated bell systems with limited customization options. There is a clear need for a modern solution that allows flexible scheduling, personalized sounds, and automatic playback. A system like this would not only improve efficiency but also create a more pleasant and adaptable school environment. By enabling custom templates and easy configuration, the program aims to simplify daily operations and better meet the unique needs of each institution.

**About:** It's a course project in the first block of the industrial programming at [Yandex Academy Lyceum](https://lyceum.yandex.ru/). This software is installed on local school servers and school system administrators or informatics teachers will load a `.xlsx` schedule and music files. Done! More interesting features: like stylization, for example, New Year music for the pre-Christmas study period.

### Functionality

The program has two types of users: **guest** and **administrator**. The administrator has access to all features, including the ability to edit data. The guest, on the other hand, can only view the content.

<div align="center">
    <img src="./images/img.png" width="550">
</div>

The program offers the following features:

- Adding and editing schedules
- Creating themed bell templates

On the left, there is a menu that allows quick access to any tab.
There are three tabs:

- Home
- Timetable
- Template

</div>

### Tech Stack
The primary and only programming language used is Python 3.10. To bring all ideas to life, the following technologies were used:

For creating the graphical user interface — `PyQt5`

For automatic bell playback — the `threading` module from Python’s standard library, used for multithreading

For schedule management — the `schedule` from python standart library 

You can find the complete list of libraries and their versions in the [requirements.txt](/requirements.txt) fil.

### System design
While designing the project architecture, I aimed to follow classic patterns such as MVC, the S.O.L.I.D principles, the Gang of Four design patterns, and others. The structure is divided into traditional layers:

First, the logic layer, where I moved all technical processes. This is implemented in the following files:
`data_ceking.py`, `base_of_data.py`, and `services.py`.

Second, the user interaction layer, which includes everything related to the program’s interface, data input, and output. This is represented by the main entry-point file:
`views.py`.

The program consists of several classes that interact with each other. The main class is Window, which directly or indirectly communicates with other classes. There is also a DataBaseManager class, instances of which can be created within other classes to handle all database operations.

You can find details on the remaining classes in [`docs`](/docs) directory.

### How to run it
One command with `uv`:
```sh
uv run python schoolring
```
